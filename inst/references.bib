		  restructured forest ecosystems at large spatial scales over
		  the past 100 years. These events threaten biodiversity
		  associated with impacted host trees and other resources
		  valued by human societies even when they do not directly
		  cause host extinction. 2. Invasion of Phytophthora ramorum
		  and emergence of the forest disease sudden oak death has
		  caused a large-scale decline of tanoak (Notholithocarpus
		  densiflorus) in Californian coastal forests. Here, we
		  describe structural changes to tanoak forests and develop
		  predictive models of infection rates, mortality rates and
		  changes in tanoak biomass and abundance by combining
		  regionally extensive longitudinal field studies and
		  mathematical modelling. 3. Pathogen-invaded stands had
		  smaller average tanoak tree size and higher proportions of
		  large dead tanoak trees compared with uninvaded stands.
		  This pattern is caused in part by a positive relationship
		  between tanoak size and mortality rate, as well as prolific
		  basal sprouting from trees killed by the disease. Tanoak
		  infection, mortality and biomass decline rates were
		  positively related to the prevalence of infection in
		  sporulation-supporting species, especially California bay
		  laurel (Umbellularia californica). 4. We developed a
		  stage-structured and spatially explicit mathematical model
		  including species dynamics and P. ramorum transmission,
		  where the long-term outcome of disease ranges from host
		  extinction when densities of bay laurel are high to limited
		  or no disease outbreak. Low densities of tanoak in a matrix
		  of non-susceptible neighbouring species resulted in
		  slow-enough transmission to retain overstorey tanoak,
		  suggesting host-density thresholds may exist in real
		  forests. 5.Synthesis. Tanoak is likely to persist in many
		  disease-impacted forests via vegetative reproduction, but
		  overstorey trees may be eliminated or greatly reduced in
		  abundance, a pattern similar to other forest diseases that
		  have emerged in the last century including chestnut blight
		  and beech bark disease. Our results support a general model
		  of disease-caused changes to forest trees useful for the
		  analysis of emerging forest pathogens where vegetative
		  reproduction, community-level epidemiology and
		  stage-specific mortality rate interact to determine local
		  disease intensity and host decline.},

  abstract	= {Parasites steal resources that a host would otherwise
		  direct toward its own growth and reproduction. We use this
		  fundamental notion to explain resource-dependent virulence
		  in a fungal parasite (Metschnikowia)-zooplankton host
		  (Daphnia) system and in a variety of other disease systems
		  with invertebrate hosts. In an experiment, well-fed hosts
		  died faster and produced more parasites than did austerely
		  fed ones. This resource-dependent variation in virulence
		  and other experimental results (involving growth and
		  reproduction rate/timing of hosts) readily emerged from a
		  model based on dynamic energy budgets. This model follows
		  energy flow through the host, from ingestion of food, to
		  internal energy storage, to allocation toward growth and
		  reproduction or to a parasite that consumes these reserves.
		  Acting as a consumer, the parasite catalyzes its own
		  extinction, persistence with an energetically compromised
		  host, or death of the host. In this last case, more
		  resources for the host inadvertently fuels faster parasite
		  growth, thereby accelerating the demise of the host
		  (although the opposite result arises with different
		  resource kinetics of the parasite). Thus, this model can
		  explain how resource supply drives variation in virulence.
		  This ecological dependence of virulence likely rivals
		  and/or interacts with genetic mechanisms that often garner
		  more attention in the literature on disease.},

		  We examined patterns and drivers of seasonal transmission

		  These data suggest the dominant driver of seasonal

		  To investigate the effect of a free-living stage of B.
